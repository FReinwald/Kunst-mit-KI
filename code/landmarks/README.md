landmarks.txt contains all landmarks for face database '099000', which can be downloaded here:

To run GetLandmarks.m (scale images and set landmarks manually) and TestLandmarks.m (look at the landmarks manually), unzip the landmarks_datasets.zip from the url above and run the unzipped matlab files, as they are the same like the ones listened here but already in the folder were they need to be to load the images.
